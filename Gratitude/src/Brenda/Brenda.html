            Hi, my name is Brenda Luis, and I’m a junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science. This semester I’m taking my first HTML course. I’m looking forward to diving into web development and picking up new skills that will broaden my understanding of how websites are designed and function.

            Outside of school, I several hobbies that help me destress. I love to read, and often lose track of time with my head in a book. When I need to clear my head I like to bike outdoors and enjoy the fresh air. Gaming is also a big part of my life, especially Valorant, which is my favorite game. When I tried the game about 3 years ago I hated it, but on my second try about 2 years ago I got hooked.

            Recently, my life has been filled with even more joy and chaos thanks to my new puppy, Cami. She has SOOO much energy, and is always ready to play and explore. In just a few weeks, she’s already become such an important part of our family. Watching her grow so quickly and getting to know her personality has been a great experience.

            <strong> Here is a picture of Cami!! </strong>
