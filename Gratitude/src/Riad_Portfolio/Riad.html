        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Riad. I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Houston-Downtown. My academic and research interests are primarily focused on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I have called Houston home for the past decade, which has allowed me to deeply engage with the vibrant tech community here. Upon completing my undergraduate degree, I am excited to pursue further education by enrolling in a Ph.D. program. This next step will enable me to delve deeper into my research passions and contribute to advancements in these cutting-edge fields.
          In my leisure time, I thoroughly enjoy visiting beaches and watching movies. There’s something incredibly relaxing about spending a day by the ocean, soaking up the sun, and listening to the sound of the waves. It provides a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for cinema, and watching movies is one of my favorite ways to unwind. Whether it’s a classic film or a recent release, I find joy in exploring different genres and stories through the lens of the camera.
