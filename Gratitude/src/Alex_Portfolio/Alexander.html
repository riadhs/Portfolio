		<p> Hello, my name is Alexander Cooreman! I am 21 years old, and I have been attending the University of Houston-Downtown since Fall of 2021 as a Computer Science Major. I 		was born and raised in California for more than half my life, but I have been living in Texas since 2016. 
		<p> I have been learning Computer Science since I was around 15 years old, and the first language I had real experience with was Java in high school. During high school, 		I also learned other languages such as HTML, CS, and React Native. When I started attending UHD, I started learning the C++ language in my computer science class, and now 		this semester, I am learning Python and the various languages that are involved in the creation of web pages.
		</p>

		<p> As you can see, I do have experience with creating web pages, and I personally find it to be very interesting and fun. For high school, I used to organize all my 			important links for my classes into a personal webpage to have easy access to all my resources! I even used a marquee to give myself reminders on important information! </p>
